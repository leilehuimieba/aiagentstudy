Key Takeaways 

Agents often produce outputs that head in the right direction but don't fully land on the first attempt. 

RubricMiddleware is how you tell the agent what "done" looks like — and make it keep going until it gets there. 

Most effective for tasks with clear, verifiable success criteria like passing tests, avoiding forbidden patterns, covering required sections. 

Agents are taking on more complex tasks than ever. More often than not, they fall short of the finish line. We've added RubricMiddleware to Deep Agents to fix that: you define a rubric, and the agent self-evaluates and iterates until it satisfies every criterion, or hits a configured cap. 

If you're familiar with /goal in Claude Code or Codex, this is a similar pattern. This implementation is a bit more flexible because evaluation is handled by a dedicated grader sub-agent that can call tools, reason over the full transcript, and return per-criterion feedback. 

The problem 

Some agent tasks have a clear definition of "done." A code refactor is finished when the test suite passes. A report is complete when every required section is covered. 

But agents don't always get there on the first try. As context grows larger, ambiguous instructions, tool misuse, and non-deterministic errors all compound — output quality deteriorates, and developers are left to diagnose and re-run tasks manually. 

How it works 

Before the agent run finishes, a separate grader sub-agent reviews it against the rubric. If everything passes, the run concludes. If anything falls short, the grader's per-criterion feedback is injected back into the conversation and the agent runs again. The loop terminates when the rubric is satisfied, or when a configured iteration limit is hit. 

The loop terminates on satisfied , max_iterations_reached , failed , or grader_error. 

Wiring it up 

Here's the minimal setup, broken into steps. The key idea: define a RubricMiddleware once, attach it to a deep agent, then pass a rubric string at invoke time. (If rubric is absent, the middleware does nothing.) 

1) Define RubricMiddleware 

This middleware adds a grader loop on top of the base agent. The grader is configured with: 

model : the LLM used for grading (often smaller/cheaper than your main agent model) 

system_prompt : instructions that define the grader’s role and what “good” looks like 

tools : optional tools the grader can call to gather evidence (e.g., run tests, lint, validate outputs) 

max_iterations : the maximum number of fix → re-grade loops before the run stops 
from deepagents import RubricMiddleware rubric_middleware = RubricMiddleware( model= "anthropic:claude-haiku-4-5" , system_prompt= "You are a code reviewer grading generated code against a rubric." , tools=[run_test_suite], max_iterations= 5 , ) 
2) Pass it to a deep agent 

Your deep agent should also have its own “operating instructions.” The agent’s system_prompt tells it how to do the work , while the rubric tells the grader how to judge the work . 

In the snippet below: 

model : the LLM used to generate the solution 

system_prompt : coding conventions + constraints for the agent 

middleware : attaches rubric_middleware so the agent can be iteratively corrected 
from deepagents import create_deep_agent agent = create_deep_agent( model= "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6" , system_prompt=( "You are a careful Python engineer. Write correct, readable code. " "Follow the user’s instructions exactly." ), middleware=[rubric_middleware], ) 
3) Invoke with a human message + rubric 

At invocation time you provide: 

messages : the human request (and optionally prior turns) 

rubric : a newline-delimited checklist that the grader must mark satisfied 
from langchain.messages import HumanMessage result = agent.invoke( { "messages" : [ HumanMessage( content=( "Write a Python function `find_duplicates(lst)` that returns a list of " "all elements that appear more than once in the input list, in the order " "they first appear." ) ) ], "rubric" : ( "- All tests pass in run_test_suite\n" "- The function is named `find_duplicates` and accepts a single list argument\n" ), }, config={ "configurable" : { "thread_id" : "code-generation-session" }}, ) print (result[ "messages" ][- 1 ].text) 
Rather than asking the grader to reason abstractly about correctness, we give it a run_test_suite tool to verify behavior directly. The grader can call tools to gather hard evidence before producing a verdict — and falls back to reasoning from the transcript when no tools are provided. 

Seeing it in practice 

In the code generation example above, the agent's first attempt looked correct but failed one test. The grader returned: 
"One test fails: test_unhashable. The function crashes with TypeError when encountering unhashable types like lists within the input list." 
The agent revised its implementation and passed all tests on the second iteration. The feedback isn't a generic "try again" — each criterion gets its own verdict, so the agent knows exactly what to fix. 

See the full example in this trace . 

Why it matters 

Agent outputs are probabilistic: the same prompt can succeed on one run and fall short on the next. RubricMiddleware shifts the burden of catching that variance away from the developer and onto the system. 

Instead of manually inspecting outputs and re-running failed tasks, you define what "done" looks like once and the loop handles the rest. Each retry is informed — the grader identifies exactly what's wrong and produces targeted, per-criterion feedback. 

The result: more reliable agents on tasks where correctness matters.
